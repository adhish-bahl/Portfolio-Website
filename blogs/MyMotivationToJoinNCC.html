        <h1>My Motivation To Join NCC</h1>
        <p class="justifyContent">NCC, National Cadet Corps, is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces. All those young people who want to experience what all Indian Armed Forced men experience. They can't get the same experience as Indian Armed Forced men experience but surely they can get a taste of it. </p>

        <p class="justifyContent">Since my childhood when I was capable of understanding my father's experience of his time when he was in NCC, tempted me to join NCC. But that wasn't possible as my school didn't have NCC, so I never had the option of joining NCC. My father always used to narrate his experience of being into NCC. I used to though that it would be soo much fun to experience those parades, camps and all the other sports activities. Also, I am always interested in sports and I have been involved in many sports activities in my school as well. So, me being a sports enthusiast, those NCC sports stories tempted me more and more. Joining NCC for sports isn't only the motivation. I know the difference that NCC can make to an individual and that is where most of the motivation comes from. Joining NCC is also about overall personality development, which I care about. NCC teaches discipline on a whole other level, no other organisation can do that for sure. And, how can the overall experience that NCC provides not drive somebody to join NCC? And also the feeling of being close to the Indian Armed Forces being in NCC not be a motivation to join NCC, for me it is one of the motivational factors. I just hope that all this covid situation ends fastest so that I can experience the original NCC and not the online one. Waiting to get up early for morning runs and even for morning parades.</p>

        <p class="justifyContent">One thing that I know, is that an individual who is concerned about the Indian Armed Forces and also about self will never regret joining NCC. The experience and outcome will always be worth it, much above all the sacrifices individual made. I hope that I'll be able to experience NCC offline as soon as possible.</p>
