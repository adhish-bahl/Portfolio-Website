        <h1>Experience during Screening for Enrolment</h1>
        <p class="justifyContent">I belong to batch 2020, before joining the college, Covid broke out all over the world. I have wanted to join NCC since I was in school. I was able to fulfil my dream after I joined Christ, Deemed to be University.</p>

        <p class="justifyContent">My father always used to tell me his stories when he was in NCC and after listening to his stories I used to think that NCC activities are so fun and I as a sports enthusiast always wanted to experience all those camps, parades training and everything else that the NCC had to offer, but my school did not have NCC because of which I never had the opportunity to join the NCC but then I came to Christ. I was introduced to NCC and my happiness was on another level as I was finally able to do what I wanted for a long time. I enrolled myself for NCC. We were told that we would be going through an interview process as well as a physical fitness test. My interview went well, I was not expecting my interview to go so well, the interviewers were very friendly and there were some seniors as well in the panellists. I was not the only candidate for the interview, a few more candidates were there and we were asked the same question and everyone had to answer that question. It was a great experience giving the NCC interview. Results were out in a few days after the interview of all the candidates were done and surprisingly my name was not on the list, but it was there in reserved cadets and this is how I reached here.</p>

        <p class="justifyContent">Experiencing NCC in online mode is like doing a parade without the band. It feels so empty as there are no physical activities that can be done with the NCC group. I just hope this covid thing ends soon and we get back to the ground with our clean uniform, ironed freshly.</p>
