        <p>This project is a Command Line Application(CLI), which is made using "JavaScript". It is basically a Quiz about me that is, Adhish Bahl. This game has 4 levels and as you level up, you get more points per correct answer. It also has a Leaderboard, which teels if you come in first 3 people or not. But it doesn't update the code by itself as there is no back-0end involved. I have created that using <a href="https://replit.com/" class="link link-in-between" target="_blank">replit.com</a>. This project was while I was learning JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Make sure you play it and let me know your score!</p>
